# MoTrPAC Proteomics Pipeline

***MoTrPAC Proteomics Data Analysis Pipeline***

---

# Overview

WDL implementation of a MS-GF+ based proteomics data analysis pipeline based on a pipeline language ([WDL](https://openwdl.org/)) and tools that orchestrate the execution (`caper`/`crownwell`). A prototype version of this pipeline with the details of every step can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/AshleyLab/motrpac-proteomics-pnnl-prototype)
